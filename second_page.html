     Energy is in the food you eat. And after the midochondria are done with taking and using the energy in the foods, the energy is released when you exhale. You also give out air with no oxygen when you exhale too. It is because when you breathe, the air and oxygen goes to your lungs and into the heart. After the oxygen goes through the different chambers in the heart, it goes out again into the lungs and out of your body.</p>
